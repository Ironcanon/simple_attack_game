# The dugeoner
A simple rougelike text game that I'm using to improve my python.

To run on windows: Download the repository, install python if it is not already installed using the python.exe, and run the Run.bat file.

To run on Linux/Mac OS: Install python 3.8 or newer, navigate to the python folder in the terminal and run python game_controller.py.
